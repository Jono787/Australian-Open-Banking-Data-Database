## Australian Open Banking Data Database

On 26 November 2017, the Australian Government announced the introduction of a consumer data right (CDR) in Australia. The CDR will first apply to the banking sector with a [phased introduction](#phasing-table), currently the only publically available data is product reference data which includes credit and debit cards, deposit accounts, transaction accounts, mortgages, and personal loans. Consumer data is only available to [acreddited institutions](https://www.cdr.gov.au/find-a-provider?providerType=Data%2520Recipient). Personal access to consumer data is set to be implemented post November 2021.

This repositry is an ongoing collection of Open Banking Data API endpoint URLs for Australian deposit taking institutions. The API specifications for these endpoints can be found [here](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#future-dated-obligations).
